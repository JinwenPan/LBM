# Lattice Boltzmann Method Simulation in a 2D Wind Tunnel

This project implements the **Lattice Boltzmann Method (LBM)** to simulate fluid flow in a 2D wind tunnel with a circular obstacle. The simulation provides insights into fluid behavior and demonstrates the method's capability to handle complex geometries.

## Features
- **2D fluid flow simulation** in a wind tunnel.
- Circular obstacle to study vortex shedding and flow dynamics.
- Output compatible with **ParaView** for visualization.
- Precomputed velocity results for two Reynolds number cases.

## Requirements
- A C++ compiler supporting the `make` build system.
- [ParaView](https://www.paraview.org/) for visualizing the output VTK files.

## Getting Started

### 1. Setup
1. Clone or download this repository.
2. Place all files in the same directory.

### 2. Build the Program
Run the following command in your terminal:
```bash
make
```
This will generate an executable file named `lbm` in the same directory.

### 3. Run the Simulation
To run the program, use the following command:
```bash
./lbm params_Re500.dat
```
Replace `params_Re500.dat` with the desired parameter file. The program requires a single argument: the parameter file that defines the simulation settings.

### 4. View the Results
The program generates VTK output files in the same directory. To visualize the results:
1. Open ParaView.
2. Load the generated VTK files.
3. Use ParaView's visualization tools to analyze the flow dynamics.

### 5. Precomputed Results
Two MP4 files showcasing velocity results for different Reynolds number cases are included in this directory. These can be viewed with any media player.

## File Structure
- `lbm` - The executable generated by the `make` command.
- `params_Re500.dat` - Example parameter file for Reynolds number 500.
- `Re*.vtk` - Simulation results (generated after running the program).
- `Re*.mp4` - Precomputed velocity results for two Reynolds number cases.

## Notes
- Ensure all files are in the same directory for seamless operation.
- Use ParaView for the best visualization experience.
